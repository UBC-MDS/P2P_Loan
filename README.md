## Project Summary
This project focuses on predicting loan defaults by analyzing historical data from the Lending Club platform. By performing detailed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering, the project aims to identify key factors influencing loan repayment outcomes. Advanced deep learning models are employed to detect patterns in borrower behavior, providing a robust framework for understanding repayment risks. The ultimate objective is to deliver actionable insights that enhance borrower risk assessment and support informed decision-making in loan management.
